# Speaker Together

Most conferences [I spoke at in 2020](https://ticofab.io/talks/) were remote,
and it looks like this trend is not going to reverse anytime soon. One of the
things I miss the most about the IRL events are the speaker dinners. In a remote
setting, it's way more difficult to connect than when seeing people walking around.

While looking at the list of speakers at [JLove 2020](https://jlove.konfy.care/),
I wondered how many of them I "crossed" at previous conferences without even realizing.
So I sat down, collected the speakers list of all the events where I spoke before
and wrote this little scripty app to crunch the (tiny) numbers.

For instance, this is how many times I crossed before the speakers of JLove 2020:

## Evolution of this project

I am going to update this project with as my speaking data grows.

While I don't plan to make this more complex than it is now, if other folks find this
interesting, we could work together and expand both dataset and functionality. Do get in touch if 
that's the case!
