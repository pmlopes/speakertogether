# Speaker Together

Most conferences [I spoke at in 2020](https://ticofab.io/talks/) were remote,
and it looks like this trend is not reversing anytime soon. One of the
things I miss the most about the IRL events are the speaker dinners.

While looking at the [JLove 2020](https://jlove.konfy.care/) speakers,
I wondered how many of them I "crossed" at previous conferences without even realizing.
So I sat down, collected data from all the events that I spoke at before
and wrote this little scripty app to crunch the (tiny) numbers.

For instance, this is how many times I crossed before the speakers of JLove 2020:

## Evolution of this project

I am going to update this project with as my speaking data grows.

While I don't plan to make this more complex than it is now, if other folks find this
interesting, we could work together and expand both dataset and functionality.
